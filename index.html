This page is where I'll be developing my wordpress replacement. My major issue with wordpress is how huge and bulky it is. All I want is a place to drop my photos for people to see, maybe add a few stories to those photos, and sometimes a custom page. Wordpress is built like a tank with some technologies I detest (read PHP). I'm going to finally learn web development through my latest project: this site.
<br />
<br />
So what should you expect to find? A broken site. For a long time.
<br />
<br />
Eventually the main page will look similar to it is now. Boxes of photos, fullscreen, with a tiny border between them. Titles will be overlaid with a transparency. Infinite scroll.
<br />
<br />
Posts will be redone to center around my photography. Full width photos (regardless of device). Still with a little text. Maybe comments in the future.
<br />
<br />
At first I was going to use wordpress' database but now I realize I want to make my own.
<br />
<br />
The backend will be golang probably. The front end will initially be hand coded until I add some flair like skroller and paralax features. Subtle flair.
<br />
<br />
Eventually I'll port over all my old data to here. Maybe by next summer.
